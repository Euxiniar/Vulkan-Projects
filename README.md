# Vulkan-Projects
This repository is my personal, and open source collection of Vulkan Projects

# Cloning

This repository contains submodules for some of the external dependencies, so when doing a fresh clone you need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Euxiniar/Vulkan-Projects.git
``` 

Existing repositories can be updated manually:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

# Building

This repository only work with Visual Studio 2017 for the moment.
I'll implement CMake when I'll got the time !

Enjoy !
